# ⚡ Lightning HTTP Server

A high-performance, custom-built HTTP server from scratch using Node.js `net` module, featuring trie-based routing, worker threads, and intelligent request handling.

> 🔗 **Live Server**: [https://my-http-server.onrender.com](https://my-http-server.onrender.com)

## 🌟 Features

- **Blazing Fast Routing** - Trie-based dynamic path resolution
- **Production Ready** - Rate limiting, request queueing, and prioritization
- **CPU-Intensive Task Support** - Automatic worker thread delegation
- **Zero Dependencies** - Pure Node.js implementation
- **REST API Ready** - Full JSON support with proper status codes
- **Dynamic Route Registration** - Add routes via API (no restart needed)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Test Existing Endpoints

```bash
# Home route
curl https://my-http-server.onrender.com

# Sample API endpoint
curl https://my-http-server.onrender.com/api/status
```

### 2. Create Custom Routes (No Code Needed!)

POST to `/admin/routes` with this format:

```bash
curl -X POST https://my-http-server.onrender.com/admin/routes \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "method": "GET",
    "path": "/custom-route",
    "response": {
      "statusCode": 200,
      "body": {
        "message": "Your custom response!"
      }
    }
  }'
```

Then access your new route immediately:
```bash
curl https://my-http-server.onrender.com/custom-route
```

## 🛠 Technical Highlights

| Feature              | Implementation Details              |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Trie Routing**     | O(1) route lookup complexity        |
| **Rate Limiting**    | Sliding window algorithm            |
| **Request Queue**    | Priority-based task scheduling      |
| **Worker Pool**      | Dedicated threads for heavy tasks   |
| **Graceful Shutdown**| Zero-downtime restarts              |

## 📚 API Reference

### Core Endpoints

| Endpoint          | Method | Description                          |
|-------------------|--------|--------------------------------------|
| `/`               | GET    | Home page                            |
| `/api/status`     | GET    | Server health check                  |
| `/api/compute`    | POST   | CPU-intensive task endpoint          |
| `/admin/routes`   | POST   | Register new routes dynamically      |

### Dynamic Route Examples

```json
// Simple JSON response
{
  "method": "GET",
  "path": "/hello",
  "response": {
    "statusCode": 200,
    "body": {"message": "World!"}
  }
}

// With custom headers
{
  "method": "GET",
  "path": "/secure",
  "response": {
    "statusCode": 200,
    "headers": {"X-API-Version": "1.0"},
    "body": {"data": "Protected content"}
  }
}
```

   npm start
   ```

3. Test locally
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8080
   ```

Key improvements:
1. Added visual hierarchy with emojis and sections
2. Included curl examples for immediate testing
3. Highlighted the dynamic route feature prominently
4. Added architecture diagram placeholder
5. Included deployment button
6. Made the live server URL stand out
7. Added license section
8. Organized features in an easy-to-scan table

Would you like me to:
1. Add a real architecture diagram?
2. Include specific performance benchmarks?
3. Add more complex API examples?
4. Include client SDK examples (JavaScript/Python)?
